# CAR-economic-TS-analysis

The goal of this analysis is to visualize and understand the economic trajectory of the Central African Republic (CAR) since its independence, with a focus on two key indicators: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and imports. GDP measures the total economic output of a country and serves as a primary indicator of economic health and growth. Imports represent the value of goods and services brought into the countryy and can reflect both domestic demand and international economic integration. By analyzing trends in these two variables, we aim to assess past performance and forecast the CARâ€™s future economic prospects.

This study will utilize time series analysis to provide insight into this data. Time series analysis is a statistical approach used to analyze data points collected or recorded at successive time intervals, where observations are typically not independent but influenced by preceding values. The primary goal is to understand the underlying structure and patterns in the data, such as trends, cycles, and seasonality, and to use this information for forecasting future values. Two common components of time series models are autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) terms. AR models predict future values based on past observations, while MA models use past forecast errors to improve predictions. To help determine the appropriate model, we will use autocorrelation functions (ACF) and partial autocorrelation functions (PACF), which graphically display how data points in the series are correlated with their past values across different time lags.

This study analyzes a dataset containing annual economic data for the Central African Republic from 1960 to 2017, consisting of 58 rows and 9 columns. The dataset includes key indicators such as GDP, economic growth, population, consumer price index (CPI), imports, and exports. All statistical tests in this study are conducted at a significance level of 0.1. The analysis proceeds in three main stages: first, exploring the data to assess whether transformations or differencing are necessary to achieve stationarity and homoscedasticity; second, selecting and fitting the most appropriate time series model using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as the model selection criterion; and third, using the finalized models to generate forecasts and assess the future economic trajectory of the country.
